    In this exercise, I used Pythonâ€™s Regular Expressions (Regex) to extract email addresses from text. The sample paragraph contained several emails such as info@university.edu, contact@datasciencehub.org, and laiba.azhar01@gmail.com. Using the re module and a suitable pattern, the code successfully identified and printed all valid emails from the text. This method is very helpful in automating email collection from large text files or websites.
